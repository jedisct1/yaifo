=========================================================================

There are some situations where a modified installer for OpenBSD is
useful. For example if you want to remotely install without any 
access to a keyboard or serial terminal. Or you would like to do
a RAID installation, which is not supported by default.
Another example is a fully automatic installations.

At the moment only remote install via Secure Shell is implemented.

There is no binary installer available, you should always compile
it on your own.

Building:
==========
As first step you need to modify the configuration file "config".
See the comments in the file.
Then create or copy a RSA2 public key into authorized_keys in this
directory. Some of my machines are really slow so I like to create
only RSA2 host keys for installation. (ssh-keygen -t rsa)
You may also copy the /etc/ssh/ssh_host* files to this directory
if you are upgrading an existing installation.

To build and compile the installer you should have the OpenBSD source tree
in /usr/src and then:
  1. Set the SUDO variable, if necessary (export SUDO=/usr/bin/sudo) if you
     are building yaifo as a non-root user.
  2. Copy /etc/ssh/ssh_host*_key* files:
     (sudo cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host*_key* . ; sudo chown `id -un` ssh_host*_key*).
  3. Copy your authorized_keys file (cp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys .).
  4. Edit the config file for your desired network settings.
  5. If serial console redirection is necessary, edit the boot.conf file.
  6. make cleanall (only necessary if yaifo was previously built)
  7. make obj
  8. make

Installation with yaifo.fs:
===========================

Use dd to put the yaifo.fs image on the hard disk. 
Overwriting the root partition of a running OpenBSD system do not work
without single usermode and read-only mounted root partition.
For such installations/upgrades use yaifo.rd with the existing boot
loader.

Example for an OpenBSD system wth a SCSI disk:
# dd if=yaifo.fs of=/dev/rsd0c
# sync
# reboot

Example for a Linux rescue system and an IDE disk:
# wget http://www.openbsd.de/~wbx/yaifo.fs -O - | dd of=/dev/hda
# sync
# reboot

Or OpenBSD via ftp:
# ftp -o - 192.168.1.2:/yaifo.fs | dd of=/dev/rwd0c
# sync
# reboot

Reboot and connect via ssh root@ip-address and install as normal.

Installation with yaifo.rd:
===========================
You can use yaifo.rd to boot from an installed system or via network. 

Notes on OpenBSD/macppc:
========================
There is no yaifo.fs for macppc.
To use the yaifo.rd from within OS X, copy yaifo.rd and ofwboot to the root
directory in OS X.  Reboot and get into Openfirmware (Cmd,Option,O,F).
Type: boot hd:,ofwboot /yaifo.rd

Notes on OpenBSD/sparc:
=======================
The standard bootloader does not allow RAMDISK's bigger than 3.8 MB, so
you have to use bootloaders compiled with RELOC=0x480000 to boot yaifo images.
For OpenBSD/sparc you need yaifo.net instead of boot.net in your tftpboot
directory. 

Notes on OpenBSD/landisk:
=========================
This is a work in progress and is considered broken at this time.
